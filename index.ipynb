    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Access to clean and functional water sources is a fundamental necessity, yet many regions in Tanzania struggle to provide reliable water points for their population of over 67 million. Despite numerous water points being established across the country, a significant number are either non-functional or in need of repair. This situation hampers access to clean water, leading to health challenges, time lost in fetching water, and increased burdens on communities, particularly women and children.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project seeks to address this issue by building a machine learning model to classify the operational status of water points. By analyzing data related to water point features such as pump type, installation details, and geographic characteristics, the project aims to predict whether a water point is functional, functional but requiring repair, or non-functional. Such insights can empower stakeholders to take targeted and proactive actions to improve water access."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In Tanzania, many water points fail to provide reliable access to clean water, impacting millions of people and burdening rural communities. As a data scientist, my goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict the operational status of water points—functional, in need of repair, or non-functional. This will enable stakeholders to prioritize maintenance, allocate resources effectively, and address systemic issues, ensuring sustainable access to clean water for the population."
